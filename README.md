# 2SRS: Two-Stream Residual Separable Convolution Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification
This is the official implementation (in Keras) of the proposed method in the paper [2SRS: Two-Stream Residual Separable Convolution Neural Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10035298)

## Pre-requirements
- Python 3.11
- Any Jupyter Notebook IDE

## How To Run (Recommended)
1. Install Python 3.11
2. Create a virtual environment: ```python -m venv venv```
3. Activate the virtual environment: ```venv\Scripts\activate```
4. Install the requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
5. Run the Jupyter Notebook ```2SRS.ipynb```
